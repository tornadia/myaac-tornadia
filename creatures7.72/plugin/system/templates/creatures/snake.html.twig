Their tactic is to hide in the grass and pop up when a victim approaches. Relying on their poisonous bite they even attack humans when they feel cornered.</p>  <p>Snakes have 15 hitpoints. They are strong against earth and energy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire and ice damage. It takes 205 mana to summon these creatures but they cannot be convinced.</p>  <p>Snakes yield 10 experience points. They carry nothing with them.</p>  </div></div>
