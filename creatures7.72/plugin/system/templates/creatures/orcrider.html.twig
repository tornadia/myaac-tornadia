Their fearsome steeds make them fast and agile while their heavy lances can deal impressive damage. Orc Rider patrols can mostly be found in the plains of Tibia where the terrain is ideal for mounted combat. It is very difficult to run away from a pack of Orc Riders once you have had the misfortune to meet them.</p>  <p>Orc Riders have 180 hitpoints. They are strong against energy and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and earth damage. It takes 490 mana to convince these creatures but they cannot be summoned.</p>  <p>Orc Riders yield 110 experience points. They carry gold coins, meat, orc leather, warwolf fur, wolf tooth chains and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
