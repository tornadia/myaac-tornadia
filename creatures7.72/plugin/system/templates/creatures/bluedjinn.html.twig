<div style="position: relative; top: 25px; clear: both; "><div style="height: 64px; margin-bottom: 5px;">  <h2 style="float: right;">Blue Djinns</h2>  <img src="images/creatures/bluedjinn.gif"/></div><div style="margin-bottom: 35px; clear: both;">  <p>Although the Blue Djinns are considered entities of goodness they tend to guard their secrets well from nosy explorers, diligently performing any task they accepted. Being highly magical creatures, they are masters of illusion and transformation. Djinns are known for their witchcraft and fairy-tales commonly narrate about djinns granting people wishes. Magicians often mock this idea, arguing that only djinns bound by powerful magic feel obliged to such duties. Be that as it may, Blue Djinns are the weakest of their kind. Searching the world for the servants of evil and their eternal nemesis, the green djinns, they still pose a threat for all those they suspect of being in league with evil.</p>  <p>Blue Djinns have 330 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against energy, fire and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Blue Djinns yield 215 experience points. They carry carrots, gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
