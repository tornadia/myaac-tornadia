They do not only hunt animals but also attack travellers and adventurers. Although they are not strong, they are very deadly due to their quickness and their bows.</p>  <p>Hunters have 150 hitpoints. They are strong against holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against physical damage. It takes 530 mana to convince these creatures but they cannot be summoned.</p>  <p>Hunters yield 150 experience points. They carry arrows, hunter's quivers, oranges, rolls and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
