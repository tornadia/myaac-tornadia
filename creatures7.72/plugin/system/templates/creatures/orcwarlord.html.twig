Orc Warlords are the strongest fighters of their race who have managed to rise to the highest ranks through treachery and murder. Even though they are extremely skilled fighters who can cut a man in two with a single stroke of their mighty blades, Orc Warlords prefer to use their superior speed and cunning to overcome their enemies. They avoid open combat whenever they can, sneaking up on unwary adventurers from behind or throwing their vicious shuriken instead.</p>  <p>Orc Warlords have 950 hitpoints. They are strong against energy, fire and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and earth damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Orc Warlords yield 670 experience points. They carry broken helmets, fish, gold coins, orc leather, orc teeth, throwing stars and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
