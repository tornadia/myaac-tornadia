They are absolutely peaceable and very affectionate. As they yield neither experience nor loot, killing them may be considered pure cruelty by animal-rights activists, and they might take revenge.</p>  <p>Dogs have 20 hitpoints. It takes 220 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Dogs yield 0 experience points. They carry nothing with them.</p>  </div></div>
