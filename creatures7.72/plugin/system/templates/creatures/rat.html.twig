Cropping up in masses they are a real plague, and the governments pay head money for dead Rats. They are quite weak, but in packs they can be dangerous for badly equipped adventurers.</p>  <p>Rats have 20 hitpoints. They are strong against earth and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and ice damage. It takes 200 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Rats yield 5 experience points. They carry cheese and gold coins with them.</p>  </div></div>
