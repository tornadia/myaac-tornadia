Typically found in their underground lairs, they also inhabit sacred places such as temples or tombs. Scarabs protect their charge with ferocious intent. They will attack anyone who dares to intrude their area and will not relent until the threat is eliminated. Their shells are immensely hard and sometimes weapons might get caught in their chitinous armor. They are able to concentrate their poison in a deadly cloud of nauseating fumes that especially cover their retreat if overwhelmed.</p>  <p>Scarabs have 320 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against energy, ice and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire damage. It takes 395 mana to summon these creatures but they cannot be convinced.</p>  <p>Scarabs yield 120 experience points. They carry gold coins, meat and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
