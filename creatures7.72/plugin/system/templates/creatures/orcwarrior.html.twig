They are weaker than berserkers, but using their sabres or daggers they can be quite dangerous in the small corridors of the dungeons. Watch out for other types of orcs - like spearmen or shamans - which might hide in the second row.</p>  <p>Orc Warriors have 125 hitpoints. They are strong against energy and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and earth damage. It takes 360 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Orc Warriors yield 50 experience points. They carry broken helmets, gold coins, meat and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
