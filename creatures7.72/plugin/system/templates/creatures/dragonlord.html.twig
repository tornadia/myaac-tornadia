They are even more powerful than normal dragons that can usually be found in their company. Like normal dragons, they can throw fireballs, spit fire, and heal themselves, but they can also throw great fire bombs.</p>  <p>Dragon Lords have 1900 hitpoints. They are immune to fire damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against earth and energy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Dragon Lords yield 2100 experience points. They carry dragon ham, gold coins, green mushrooms and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
