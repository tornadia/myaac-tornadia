Their interest in our existence is limited at best and they are usually summoned by sorcerers than materialising on their own. The apparently uncontrolled Water Elementals seem to follow no purpose that we mortals could comprehend. Some sorcerers believe that they react hostile to living creatures because they feel offended by all the water a living creature contains. Although enigmatic in their motivation, they are indisputably intelligent and possess an array of spells that centre around water, poison and cold.</p>  <p>Water Elementals have 550 hitpoints. They are immune to earth, fire and ice damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, holy and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Water Elementals yield 650 experience points. They carry fish, gold coins, platinum coins, strong health potions, strong mana potions and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
