Its meat is not edible and only its feathers might have some value. Chasing this shy but fast bird is not recommended since you can quickly run in one of the predators of the jungle, and to expose yourself to this danger is not worth it. Some wealthy persons like to adorn their gardens with those lovely birds, and since it is quite difficult to catch a Flamingo alive, these animals achieve good prices on the market.</p>  <p>Flamingos have 25 hitpoints. It takes 250 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Flamingos yield 0 experience points. They rarely carry items with them.</p>  </div></div>
