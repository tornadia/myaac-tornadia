They can heal themselves and they know how to drain life energy off their opponents. Although they are quite strong fighters, they prefer distance fighting, namely shooting magic missiles and letting their summoned servants fight for them.</p>  <p>Necromancers have 580 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage. Moreover, they are strong against death, energy and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire, holy and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Necromancers yield 580 experience points. They carry books of necromantic rituals, gold coins, poison arrows and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
