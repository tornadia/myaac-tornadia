Some people say that they are the souls of the former inhabitants, which died in that horrible disaster destroying the once beautiful city. Indeed they are supernatural in some way, as no physical weapon can hit them, and their shivering touch makes their opponents loose some vitality.</p>  <p>Ghosts have 150 hitpoints. They are immune to death, earth and physical damage and cannot be paralyzed. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced.</p>  <p>Ghosts yield 120 experience points. They carry morning stars, shadow herbs and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
