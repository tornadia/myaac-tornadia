They patrol the area around their dwellings and repel intruders. Due to their tall bodies, all elves are fast runners and can cover large distances. In close combat they are quite weak, but their distance fighting weapons are dreaded.</p>  <p>Elf Scouts have 160 hitpoints. They are strong against holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death damage. It takes 360 mana to convince these creatures but they cannot be summoned. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Elf Scouts yield 75 experience points. They carry arrows, elven scouting glasses, gold coins, grapes, poison arrows and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
