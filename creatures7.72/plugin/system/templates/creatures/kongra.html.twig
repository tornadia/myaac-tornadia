These enormous apes are incredibly strong and quite agile for their mass and size. They seem to be the warriors of the apes that live in the deepest jungle and raid the human settlements from time to time. In its anger a Kongra is able to rip out small trees and to break bones as if they weretwigs. The sight of an enraged, storming Kongra can make even an experienced warrior tremble. The dark and massive figure reaches a threatening speed in its attacks. Relying mainly on its strength, a Kongra rarely uses any weapons. Occasionally, the ape warrior uses stones of different sizes or branches as makeshift weapons, but usually it relies on its hammer-like fists and the clout of its powerful arms.</p>  <p>Kongras have 340 hitpoints. They are strong against earth, energy and fire damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced.</p>  <p>Kongras yield 115 experience points. They carry bananas, gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
