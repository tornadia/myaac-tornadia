They usually hunt small animals, but do not shrink back from attacking animals that are bigger than them. When they crop up in packs, they can even become dangerous for badly equipped adventurers.</p>  <p>Spiders have 20 hitpoints. They are weak against fire damage. It takes 210 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Spiders yield 12 experience points. They carry gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
