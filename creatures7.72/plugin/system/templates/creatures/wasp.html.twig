Using their poisonous sting they attack other animals. As they are very quick it is impossible to flee from them. If you hear their thrilling buzz, it is too late to escape. As their defence is quite weak you should try to do the first strike.</p>  <p>Wasps have 35 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire damage. It takes 280 mana to summon these creatures but they cannot be convinced.</p>  <p>Wasps yield 24 experience points. They rarely carry items with them.</p>  </div></div>
