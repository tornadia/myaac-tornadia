They are not well disposed towards the explorers that are now coming there, and will attack every intruder fiercely. They are skilled fist fighters and can heal themselves.</p>  <p>Monks have 240 hitpoints. They are strong against death and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against physical damage. It takes 600 mana to summon these creatures but they cannot be convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Monks yield 200 experience points. They carry breads, gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
