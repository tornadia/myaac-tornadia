Their favourite tactic is the assault, where they can use their velocity and their halberds to kill their victim with a single stroke. Having survived their attack, watch out for other types of orcs that are usually in their company.</p>  <p>Orc Berserkers have 210 hitpoints. They are strong against energy and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and earth damage. It takes 590 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Orc Berserkers yield 195 experience points. They carry gold coins, ham, orcish gear and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
