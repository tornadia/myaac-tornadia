Considered to be extinct, the last knowledge of these powerful beings turned into legends and legends became fairy-tales. Those who have encountered the recently resurfaced, self-proclaimed masters of evil can attest that they are indeed, a reality, and not a pleasant one. These magic-wielding enemies of all good embrace destruction and enjoy causing pain. Although only inferior members of the green-skinned race have been sighted until now, they are enemies to beware of.  Their magical tricks make them more than a match for unexpecting adventurers. Despising all living beings and everything that is beautiful, their especially passionate hatred is reserved for their blue-skinned relatives, whom they regard as traitors to djinnkind.</p>  <p>Green Djinns have 330 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, energy, fire and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Green Djinns yield 215 experience points. They carry cheese, gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
